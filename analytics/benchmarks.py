"""The Volleyball 7: per-match benchmarks for grading a team.

Each benchmark is a binary test a team clears or misses in a match. Counting them
gives a 0-7 match grade; averaging over a season grades the team.

WHY SEVEN AND NOT FOURTEEN
--------------------------
This started as a 14-benchmark set modeled on football scorecards. Volleyball does
not support fourteen independent measurements, for a structural reason: every rally
is won by exactly one team and is either a side-out or a point-score, so most
"different" volleyball stats are components of the same two numbers.

Measured on 37,118 team-matches (women's D1, 2021-2024):

  * Two of the original fourteen were ALGEBRAIC IDENTITIES, not merely correlations:
        hitting efficiency == kill% - attack error%              (max diff 1.1e-16)
        side-out% == fbso% + (1 - fbso%) * transition side-out%  (max diff 2.2e-16)
    In each trio the third number carries exactly zero new information. Three
    benchmarks had infinite VIF; three more had VIF between 42 and 159.

  * PCA on the fourteen: PC1 explains 40.9% of variance, and 6 components cover 80%.
    The effective dimensionality is around six, not fourteen.

  * Cutting to six costs nothing. Same-match discrimination (AUC) 0.9535 vs 0.9590
    for all fourteen; forward prediction is actually slightly better. Equal-weight
    counting means every added benchmark is an implicit weight, so redundant or
    weakly-discriminating ones dilute the score rather than sharpen it -- an
    8-benchmark variant scored WORSE than that 6 (AUC 0.9487).

  * The seventh, hitting margin, was then added back because it is the one addition
    that carries genuinely new information. The absolute pair (own hit% >= .199,
    opp hit% <= .199) tests two fixed bars independently and loses the relationship
    between them: .190 against an opponent held to .050 scores 1/2 despite being
    dominant, while .210 against .195 scores 2/2 despite being a coin flip. Margin
    fixes both. It has the highest single-benchmark lift measured anywhere in this
    work (+81.1) and lifts set AUC 0.9535 -> 0.9635.

    That gain is information, not arithmetic: adding a DUPLICATE of an existing
    benchmark instead (a free extra scale level, zero new information) moves AUC to
    0.9523 / 0.9491 / 0.9534 -- at or below the 6-benchmark baseline.

    The threshold is ZERO -- simply out-hit the opponent -- not some large margin.
    A .250 bar is cleared in only 6% of team-matches and drops set AUC to 0.9178.
    The intuition it is meant to protect (hitting poorly yourself while smothering
    the opponent) is almost nonexistent at D1 level: in all of 2024, only 12 of 9,594
    team-matches hit under .199 while holding the opponent below .000, and only 3
    paired sub-.199 hitting with a .250+ margin.

THRESHOLDS ARE EMPIRICAL. Each is the value maximizing win/loss discrimination across
2021-2023, constrained to a 30-70% hit rate, then validated out-of-sample on 2024.

TRANSITION SHARE: TESTED AND REJECTED
------------------------------------
Share of a team's attacks that come in transition rather than off serve receive
correlates +0.459 with winning a match, higher than most graded benchmarks. It is
nonetheless an artifact of rally scoring, not a measure of defense.

Decomposing it, the denominator does the work: transition attacks per set correlates
only +0.267 with winning, while FIRST-BALL attacks per set correlates -0.420. The
cause is structural -- a team serves only after winning a rally, so a dominant team
serves more and receives less. Receive rallies per set correlates -0.692 with winning
(winners 19.7 per set, losers 23.7), and first-ball attacks track receive rallies at
+0.719. Winning therefore shrinks the denominator and inflates transition share with
no change in defensive quality.

Confirmed by the forward test, which strips same-match tautology: transition share
predicts second-half win% at only r=+0.291, well below win-loss record (+0.487) and
side-out% (+0.509). It is also largely redundant with what is already graded
(r=+0.742 with digs per set, -0.596 with opponent hitting efficiency, +0.540 with
point-score%). Its margin form scores better (+60.5 lift, AUC 0.9659) but that is the
antisymmetry effect described above, and it still fails to beat the raw record
forward (+0.473). Not added.

WHY ONLY HITTING IS EXPRESSED AS A MARGIN
----------------------------------------
Every benchmark here has a relative form (out-do the opponent rather than clear a
fixed bar), and every one of those has larger lift than the absolute it replaces:
rally margin +84.4, hitting +81.1, kill% +76.4, transition +68.9, first-ball +62.3,
against +64.6 for the best absolute. Converting the whole set anyway makes it worse.

The reason is that a margin is ANTISYMMETRIC: one team's margin is exactly minus the
other's, so the two teams' scores correlate at r = -1.00 and both sides can never
clear the same bar. Absolute benchmarks are not zero-sum -- both teams clear
"hitting eff >= .199" in 21% of matches and "side-out% >= 58.3%" in 12%. A margin
therefore asks "did you win this phase", which is close to asking "did you win the
match": high lift, little information. Measured:

    all-absolute 6   AUC 0.9540   forward r +0.500   quality-in-defeat 0.148
    current 7 (mix)  AUC 0.9643   forward r +0.501   quality-in-defeat 0.154
    all-relative 6   AUC 0.9540   forward r +0.481   quality-in-defeat 0.131

Going fully relative gains no discrimination and loses forward prediction and the
ability to recognize a good team playing well in defeat. Adding further margins to
the current seven moves forward r only from +0.501 to at most +0.505 -- noise.

Hitting was the exception because own hit% and opp hit% were two absolutes testing
the SAME battle from opposite ends, so their relationship was information the pair
had discarded. Side-out% and point-score% are not two ends of one battle; they are
two different phases (receiving vs serving). Their margin is literally their sum
minus one, so collapsing them destroys the most actionable split in the sport --
"our side-out is elite but we cannot score on serve" -- in exchange for a number
that mostly restates the result.

A caution that applies to the grade however it is built: season grade correlates
about 0.95 with season win% for every variant tested. At season level this scorecard
largely restates the standings. Its value is per-match diagnosis, not ranking.

WHAT THE GRADE IS FOR, AND WHAT IT ISN'T
----------------------------------------
  * Diagnostic: it localizes *where* a team wins or loses. That is the reason to keep
    seven rather than collapse to two -- side-out% and point-score% alone reach AUC
    0.9221, close on discrimination but useless for telling a coach what broke.
  * Descriptive: the same-match grade ladder is near-deterministic and largely
    tautological -- it grades performance in the match whose result it is compared to.
  * NOT a predictive edge. Forward-tested (first half of season -> second half win%),
    the count reaches r=+0.506, no better than side-out% alone (+0.509) and barely
    ahead of raw win-loss record (+0.487). Adding the margin improved description
    (AUC) without moving prediction (+0.504 -> +0.506) -- consistent with everything
    else here: nothing in this family of stats predicts better than opponent
    adjustment does. Opponent-adjusted net rating (+0.549) is
    what should rank and project teams. Grade with this; rank with that.

Thresholds are calibrated on women's D1. Men's and D2/D3 distributions differ enough
to require recalibration before reuse.
